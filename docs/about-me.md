# About Me

## Who I Am

I'm Ariel Villanea, a software architect who's been in the industry since 2008 building scalable, sustainable enterprise solutions. I was born in Costa Rica and raised across California and Florida, and am now residing in Minnesota. 

I've spent nearly two decades turning complex technical challenges into elegant, long-lasting systems. I specialize in the C#/.NET ecosystem and focus on delivering **enterprise expertise without enterprise overhead**; providing Fortune 500-quality architecture and implementation without the traditional agency markup or vendor lock-in cycles.

## What Drives Me?

I'm energized by building systems that last 7-10+ years, not solutions designed for perpetual upgrades. Whether it's architecting AI orchestrators with .NET Aspire, modernizing legacy codebases, or designing sustainable architectures from scratch, I'm passionate about creating technology that serves people and organizations for the long haul.

My approach combines deep technical expertise with future-focused thinking. I don't just solve today's problems, I architect solutions that anticipate tomorrow's needs while remaining maintainable and cost-conscious.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting software solutions, you'll find me immersed in gaming, music, and anime; basically anything that falls under the 'nerd culture' umbrella. I've run and played in numerous D&D campaigns over the years, which I've found to be surprisingly effective team-building exercises.

## Current Focus

After recently transitioning away from management roles, I'm focused on what I do best: Hands-on Technical Architecture and Solutions Engineering. I'm currently pursuing Solutions Architect and Principal Engineer positions (remote or local in the Minneapolis area), where I can apply my expertise in building sustainable, high-impact systems.

I'm particularly interested in opportunities that value architectural thinking, sustainable design, and the kind of technical leadership that bridges business and engineering teams. Throughout my career, I've often found myself mediating between IT and Marketing (or other departments) when they're at odds. I've been consistently praised by both sides for my ability to cut through departmental tensions, provide honest assessments of technical realities and business constraints, and facilitate collaborative solutions where the company wins; not just one department being "right" over another. Real progress happens when technical teams understand business needs and business teams understand technical constraints.
